# Game World

## Setting

This game takes place in a fairly typical high-fantasy world. There are elves, dwarves, humans, and gnomes, etc. Picture
your usual Tolkein or D&D setting. There are forests, mountains, rivers, and so on. The world is populated with various
creatures which I'll leave up to the imagination except for the ones I mention in the story or data files.

The world is relatively high-magic: the player will have access to a magic system, which is not uncommon for people in
the world. There are also magical creatures and artifacts.

There will also be elements of Cosmic Horror scattered throughout. A good example is the way that D&D or Pathfinder's
world of Golarion include Cosmic Horror.

## Song of Cassilda

Along the shore the cloud waves break,
The twin suns sink behind the lake,
The shadows lengthen
In Carcosa.

Strange is the night where black stars rise
And strange moons circle through the skies
But stranger still is
Lost Carcosa

Songs that the Hyades shall sing,
Where flap the tatters of the King,
Must die unheard in
Dim Carcosa.

Song of my soul, my voice is dead,
Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed
Shall dry and die in
Lost Carcosa.

## Story Synopsis

The story of this world takes place in the world of Golarion, the setting from the Pathfinder RPG. The player will start
in a cabin near a small village in Taldor. The player is a member of the Pathfinder Society, who was sent to find an
amulet which was stolen from the Grand Archive in Absalom. The amulet is said to be in the possession of a noble who
lives in a manor in the village. However, the hero was given compelling information that suggests that
the amulet itself might be in this noble's cabin outside of town. The player must find the amulet and return it to the
Society.

The cabin is fairly large and ornate, complete will all the accoutrement of a noble's home. It overlooks a beautiful
lake on one side and a dense forest on the other. The player will have to explore the cabin and the surrounding area to
figure out where the amulet may be and secure it.
