# Game World

## Setting

This game takes place in a fairly typical high-fantasy world. There are elves, dwarves, humans, and gnomes, etc. Picture 
your usual Tolkein or D&D setting. There are forests, mountains, rivers, and so on. The world is populated with various 
creatures which I'll leave up to the imagination except for the ones I mention in the story or data files.  

The world is relatively high-magic: the player will have access to a magic system, which is not uncommon for people in 
the world. There are also magical creatures and artifacts.  

There will also be elements of Cosmic Horror scattered throughout. A good example is the way that D&D or Pathfinder's 
world of Golarion include Cosmic Horror.
